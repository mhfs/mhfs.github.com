p. When I got my MacBook I was in the middle of a RoR development project and needed to get everything up and running really quick. After trying a couple of approaches and wasting a lot of precious time I ended up in this <a href="http://hivelogic.com" target="_blank">Hivelogic</a> article.

p. My unique intention with this post is to offer a straight answer on how to setup a RoR environment. Follow their guide. You'll get everything up even if it's the first time you're looking to a Mac.
