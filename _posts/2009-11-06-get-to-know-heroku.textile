If you're looking for a hosting solution for your Rails app I have a suggestion. Try out "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com/.

It's a git based deploy solution really easy to get running and with a decent free plan for small apps.

Once you start getting more traffic/data you can dynamically scale resources.

My blog is running on a free Heroku plan for a couple of months now and I have no complaints. I have some difficulties when deploying it but their support were great even for the free plan. And it was my fault on the .gems file anyway.

Now that I feel comfortable having tested it with my blog I'll start migrating/deploying some other apps to it.

And keep an eye on the AddOns. They're getting better everyday.

Cheers!
