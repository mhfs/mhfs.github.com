Since my move from PHP to Ruby some months ago I was desiring to move the PHP systems I use to something Ruby based. Mainly this Blog which originally used Wordpress.

My personal stuff has always been a tech playground and I was missing it so I started searching for alternatives. I looked into Mephisto, SimpleBlog and Radiant but they all looked more of the same. I was aiming on something I could have more control of and ended up facing "Enki Blog":http://www.enkiblog.com/. 

Enki is a no fluff, straight Rails blog app, conceived to allow developers to dive into it and customize whatever they want. It's like a ready to use blog scaffold I can evolve in any way I want.

The migration process was very simple with the help of this "simple script":http://github.com/rb2k/enki-wp-importer/.

In some aspects it represented a couple of steps backwards but it will allow me to evolve in another directions more easily and, hopefully, more interestingly.

ps.: I'd like to thanks Wordpress for the good moments I had with it. Also, not choosing Mephisto or Radiant doesnt't mean they aren't good. I use Radiant myself for my company website and love it.

Cheers!
