In my humble opinion there was a major public security happening in Rio de Janeiro last week. 

An asshole tried to rob a drug store and found himself surrounded by the cops. As a good robber-asshole-coward he took a women as a hostage and started threatening to explode a hand grenade (understanding how a drug store robber was in possession of a grenade is something reserved to Brazilian people).

The cops started to negotiate and things seemed to go bad when something I'd never expect happened. A sniper shot the guy in the head. No injuries to the hostage. Being myself a victim of several robberies and other violence acts I felt really great about it.

I hope his family cries the tiers of all his victims families and his children misses all the money he robbed from someone else.

Looking forward on watching more of those.

Cheers!
