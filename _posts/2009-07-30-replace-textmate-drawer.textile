p. With the switch from my old Vaio to a MacBook I finally had the chance to dive into "TextMate":http://macromates.com/. And I have to say that it is what all the people say of it. Awesome software.

p. But like every software it has its drawbacks and one that bored me a lot is the drawer file browser which seems to doesn't be part of the window itself. A quick google search showed me I wasn't the only one who don't like it and took me to the "textmate-missingdrawer":http://code.google.com/p/textmate-missingdrawer/ plugin. Easy to install and delivers what the name states. Worth a try.

p. See the result below.
