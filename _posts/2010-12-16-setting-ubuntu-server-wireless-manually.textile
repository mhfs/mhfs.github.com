I have an old laptop that I use as a home server. I wanted to move it away from my workstation and that also means moving it away from the internet router. In other words, I had to setup the wireless connection without any visual assistent.

Turns out it wasn't that difficult. For a WPA2/AES wireless connection place this into your <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file.

{% highlight bash %}
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.10
  gateway 192.168.1.1
  dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  wpa-ssid <NETWORK_NAME>
  wpa-ap-scan 2
  wpa-proto RSN
  wpa-pairwise AES
  wpa-group AES
  wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
  wpa-psk <ASCII_ACCESS_KEY>
{% endhighlight %}

If you want DHCP instead of a static address go with this.

{% highlight bash %}
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-ssid <NETWORK_NAME>
  wpa-ap-scan 2
  wpa-proto RSN
  wpa-pairwise AES
  wpa-group AES
  wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
  wpa-psk <ASCII_ACCESS_KEY>
{% endhighlight %}

Then just run <code>sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart</code> and you should be good.

Note: This assumes you have your wireless card working with its kernel module on. You can check it out with lspci and lsmod.

Cheers!
