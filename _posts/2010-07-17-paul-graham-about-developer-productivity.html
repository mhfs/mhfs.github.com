At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one
long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company.
A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.
A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).
