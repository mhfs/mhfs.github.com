I have been investing some time in Rails3 and Ruby 1.9. Unfortunately that also means facing a lot of beta and release candidate gems.

One that I was specially missing was ruby-debug. Looking around I found "ruby-debug19":http://github.com/mark-moseley/ruby-debug but the Mac OS installation instructions are focused on MacPorts. After some research I was able to adapt the steps to my RVM based ruby install.

First, get rid of possible ruby-debug related gems:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem unsintall columnize linecache linecache19 ruby-debug-base ruby-debug-base19 
  ruby-debug ruby-debug19 ruby-debug-ide ruby_core_source
{% endhighlight %}

Then you'll have to figure out where is your ruby source code. Adapt it to your username and ruby version. It'll be something like <code>/Users/<username>/.rvm/src/<ruby-version></code>. For me it's <code>/Users/mhfs/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-preview3</code>. Adapt to your own username and ruby version.

And finally, let's install ruby-debug19.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install ruby-debug19 -- --with-ruby-include=/Users/mhfs/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-preview3
{% endhighlight %}

You should now be fine. Let me know if didn't work.

I'd like to congratulate and thank "Mark Moseley":http://github.com/mark-moseley for the port of ruby-debug to 1.9.

Cheers!
