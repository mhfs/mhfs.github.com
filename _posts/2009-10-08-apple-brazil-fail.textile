title: Apple Brazil Fail

Apple recently launched their online store in Brazil and I immediately ordered a full keyboard to use with my hot-as-hell-macbook.

The order was placed and processed on Oct 6th. The delivery was initially supposed to happen in 3 to 7 business days. From Oct 9th to Oct 15th.

Yesterday, Oct 7th, I received another email telling me they were sorry to inform my order would be shipped only on Oct 23th and could take up to Oct 30th to get to my home.

So I ask:

* how could the estimated date vary that much in 2 days?
* why are they stating on the online store they are shipping in 7 to 10 business days if my 2 days ago processed order will ship just in 12 business days?

Incredibly, It seems they still didn't learn the lesson.

Very frustrating first experience. Specially considering all my expectation. I mean, it's Apple.

Where's Tim Cook, the master of distribution and logistics?

Cheers!

Update: after all the mess with my order they ended up delivering the keyboard today, Oct 14th.
